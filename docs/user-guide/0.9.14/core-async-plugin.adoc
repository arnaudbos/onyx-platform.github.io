[[onyx-core-async]]

== onyx-core-async

Onyx plugin providing read and write facilities for Clojure core.async.

=== Installation

This plugin is included with Onyx. You do not need to add it as a
separate dependency.

In your peer boot-up namespace:

[source,clojure]
----
(:require [onyx.plugin.core-async])
----

=== Functions

==== read-from-chan

Catalog entry:

[source,clojure]
----
{:onyx/name :in
 :onyx/plugin :onyx.plugin.core-async/input
 :onyx/type :input
 :onyx/medium :core.async
 :onyx/batch-size batch-size
 :onyx/max-peers 1
 :onyx/doc "Reads segments from a core.async channel"}
----

Lifecycle entries:

[source,clojure]
----
[{:lifecycle/task :your-task-name
  :lifecycle/calls :my.ns/in-calls}
 {:lifecycle/task :your-task-name
  :lifecycle/calls :onyx.plugin.core-async/reader-calls}]
----

There's a little extra baggage with core.async because you need a
reference to the channel. Make sure that `my.ns/in-calls` is a map that
references a function to inject the channel in:

[source,clojure]
----
(def in-chan (chan capacity))

(defn inject-in-ch [event lifecycle]
  {:core.async/chan in-chan})

(def in-calls
  {:lifecycle/before-task-start inject-in-ch})
----

==== write-to-chan

Catalog entry:

[source,clojure]
----
{:onyx/name :out
 :onyx/plugin :onyx.plugin.core-async/output
 :onyx/type :output
 :onyx/medium :core.async
 :onyx/batch-size batch-size
 :onyx/max-peers 1
 :onyx/doc "Writes segments to a core.async channel"}
----

Lifecycle entries:

[source,clojure]
----
[{:lifecycle/task :your-task-name
  :lifecycle/calls :my.ns/out-calls}
 {:lifecycle/task :your-task-name
  :lifecycle/calls :onyx.plugin.core-async/writer-calls}]
----

Again, as with `read-from-chan`, there's a little extra to do since
core.async has some exceptional behavior compared to other plugins:

[source,clojure]
----
(def out-chan (chan capacity))

(defn inject-out-ch [event lifecycle]
  {:core.async/chan out-chan})

(def out-calls
  {:lifecycle/before-task-start inject-out-ch})
----

=== Utility Functions

==== `take-segments!`

This additional function is provided as a utility for removing segments
from a channel until `:done` is found. After `:done` is encountered, all
prior segments, including `:done`, are returned in a seq.
