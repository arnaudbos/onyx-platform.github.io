== Logging

This chapter details how to inspect and modify the logs that Onyx
produces.

=== Timbre

Onyx uses https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre[Timbre] for logging.

By default, all Onyx output is logged to a file called `onyx.log` in the
same directory as where the peer or coordinator jar is executing. The
logging configuration can be overridden completely, see below.

Onyx's default logging configuration writes all `WARN` and `FATAL`
messages to standard out, also.

==== Overriding the log file name and path

In order to override the log file location add `:onyx.log/file` to both
the environment config sent into `start-env` as well as the peer config
sent into `start-peer-group`.

Both relative and absolute paths are supported by Timbre.

==== Overriding the Timbre log config

Similarly, to override the full Timbre log config map, construct the
Timbre configuration and add it to both the environment and peer config
maps under the `:onyx.log/config` key. Note that the `onyx.log/config`
map will be merged with the existing Timbre configuration rather than
replacing it completely. In practice this means that extra configuration
must be sent in to, for example, disable appenders that are enabled by
default. See the examples below.

==== Examples

The following example simply changes the output file.

[source,clojure]
----
(let [log-config {:onyx.log/file "/var/log/onyx.log"}
      peer-config (merge my-peer-config log-config)
      env-config (merge my-env-config log-config)]
  (onyx.api/start-env env-config)
  (onyx.api/start-peer-group peer-config)

  ;; ...
  )
----

This example uses Timbre to redirect Onyx logs into the regular Java
logging system using the
https://github.com/palletops/log-config[log-config] library.

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[com.palletops.log-config.timbre.tools-logging :as tl])
(let [log-config {:onyx.log/config {:appenders
                                    {:spit {:enabled? false}
                                     :standard-out {:enabled? false}
                                     :rotor {:enabled? false}
                                     :jl (tl/make-tools-logging-appender
                                          {:enabled? true
                                           :fmt-output-opts {:nofonts? true}})}
                                    :min-level :trace}}
      peer-config (merge my-peer-config log-config)
      env-config (merge my-env-config log-config)]
  (onyx/start-env env-config)
  (onyx/start-peer-group peer-config)

  ;; ...
  )
----

If you already have timbre logging configured somewhere in your code
base, you can specify `:onyx.log/config {}` to ensure your settings
remain unchanged. In effect, this simply merges in the empty map into
whatever settings you may have already specified for logging.

[source,clojure]
----
(let [log-config {:onyx.log/config {}}
      peer-config (merge my-peer-config log-config)
      env-config (merge my-env-config log-config)]
  (onyx.api/start-env env-config)
  (onyx.api/start-peer-group peer-config)

  ;; ...
  )

See the Timbre
link:++https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre#configuration++[example
configuration] for more information on valid values for the
`:onyx.log/config` map.
