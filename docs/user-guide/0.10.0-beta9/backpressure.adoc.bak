[[backpressure]]

== Backpressure

A common problem with streaming platforms is whether peers and tasks can exhibit
backpressure to upstream tasks.

Onyx provides natural backpressure via Aeron's bounded term buffers. Whenever a
message is offered to a peer that has not consumed enough of its term buffer,
the offer will not succeed and a backpressure signal will be signalled back to
the peer. As Onyx's messaging is written in a non blocking way, the peer will then backoff for between

http://www.onyxplatform.org/docs/cheat-sheet/latest/#peer-config/:onyx.peer/idle-max-sleep-ns[`idle-max-sleep-ns`].

Onyx's checkpointing mechanism is also subject to backpressure as only one
checkpoint will be running for a job at any given time.
