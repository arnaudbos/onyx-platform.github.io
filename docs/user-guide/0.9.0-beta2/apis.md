## APIs

Onyx ships with two distinct APIs to accommodate different needs. A description of each follows.

### Core API

The [Core API](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx/blob/0.6.x/src/onyx/api.clj) is used to start/stop resources, jobs, and monitor job progress. It's accessible through the `onyx.api` namespace.

##### `start-env`

Starts a development environment with in-memory ZooKeeper. Helpful for developing locally without needing to start any other services.

##### `start-peer-group`

Starts a resource pool to be shared across a group of peers. You should only start one peer group per physical machine.

##### `start-peers`

Starts N virtual peers to execute tasks. In a production environment, you should start by booting up N virtual peers for N cores on the physical machine. Tune performance from there.

##### `submit-job`

Submits a job to Onyx to be scheduled for execution. Takes a map with keys `:catalog`, `:workflow`, `:flow-conditions`, `:windows`, `:triggers`, `:metadata`, and `:task-scheduler`. Returns a map of `:job-id` and `:task-ids`, which map to a UUID and vector of maps respectively. `:metadata` is a map of values that must serialize to EDN. `:metadata` will be logged with all task output, and is useful for identifying a particular task based on something other than its name or ID.

##### `await-job-completion`

Given a job ID, blocks the calling thread until all the tasks for this job have been completed.

Example project: [block-on-job-completion](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx-examples/tree/0.8.x/block-on-job-completion)

##### `gc`

Invokes the garbage collector. Compresses the replica in Zookeeper, freeing up storage and deleting log history. Frees up memory on the local, in memory replica on all peers.

##### `kill-job`

Stops this job from executing, never allowing it to be run again.

Example project: [kill-job](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx-examples/tree/0.8.x/kill-job)

##### `subscribe-to-log`

Sends all events in the log to a core.async channel. Events are received in the order that they appeared in the log. Starts from the beginning of the log, blocking until more entries are available.

##### `shutdown-peer`

Shuts down a single peer, stopping any task that it is presently executing.

##### `shutdown-peer-group`

Shuts down the peer group, releasing any messaging resources it was holding open.

##### `shutdown-env`

Shuts down the development environment and stops in memory ZooKeeper.

### Peer Pipeline API

The [Peer Pipeline API](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx/blob/0.6.x/src/onyx/peer/pipeline_extensions.clj) allows you to interact with data storage mediums to read and write data for plugins.

##### `read-batch`

Reads multiple segments off the previous element in the workflow.

##### `write-batch`

Writes the batch with the function applied to the output stream.

##### `seal-resource`

Called by one peer exactly once (subsequent calls occur if the sealing peer fails) when the task is completing. Close out target output resources.

##### `ack-segment`

Acknowledges a segment natively on the input medium, causing the segment to be released from durable storage.

##### `retry-segment`

Processes a segment again from the root of the workflow.

##### `pending?`

Given a segment ID, returns true if this segment is pending completion.

##### `drained?`

Returns true if all messages on the input medium have successfully been processed. Never returns true for an infinite message stream.
