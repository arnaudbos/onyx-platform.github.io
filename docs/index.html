      <p>We summarize the various types of documentation that support Onyx. Links to the discussed docs are on the left.

      <h2 id="cheat-sheet">cheat sheet</h2>

      <p>The Cheat Sheet is Onyx's comprehensive specification of its data model. Every allowable parameter is documented with its purpose, type, constraints, and relation to other parameters.</p>

      <h2 id="api-docs">api docs</h2>

      <p>The API docs contain the docstring level descriptions of Onyx's API. Onyx is largely data driven, so this section is fairly light. However, there are a number of important operations that you need to know about run an Onyx environment - and they are discussed here.</p>


      <h2 id="user-guide">user guide</h2>

      <p>The User Guide is the fully comphrensive guide about what Onyx is and how to use it. It contains descriptions of every feature, discussion of the architecture, deployment, performance tuning tips, and more.</p>
