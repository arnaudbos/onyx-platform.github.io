          <h2>Architectural Engagement</h2>
          <p class="support-description">Our goal isn't to make Onyx have the biggest user base of any platform. Our goal is to help you solve your problems - whatever those might be. Engage our team for architecture and design advice. A few weeks sketching out a solid, proven design can save months - if not years - of engineering time down the road.</p>

          <h2>Custom Application Construction</h2>
          <p class="support-description">Sold that Onyx can solve your problems, but can't seem to find any time in the day to prove it? Hire a developer or two from our team to start your application development for you. Whether you want a prototype, or a rock solid base to build ontop of when we're done - we can build it for you. We built Onyx, and we can wield it better than anyone.</p>
