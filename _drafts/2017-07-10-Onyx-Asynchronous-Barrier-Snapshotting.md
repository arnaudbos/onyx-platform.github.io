Distributed Masonry is proud to announce Onyx 0.10.0, a major step forward for Onyxâ€™s stream
processing engine. We have been dogfooding Onyx 0.10.0 with the demanding requirements of
our latest product [Pyroclast](http://pyroclast.io): Streaming Processing Platform as a Service.


# Background

## Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting

Onyx 0.10 rewrites the messaging and fault tolerance mechanisms using a
[Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting
(ABS)](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx/blob/0.10.x/doc/user-guide/architecture-low-level-design.adoc#asynchronous-barrier-snapshotting) [algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08603).

Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting provides numerous advantages over Onyx's previous
lineage tracking fault tolerance mechanism.

### Exactly Once Processing

Onyx 0.9 supported exactly once aggregations, however these were implemented
via deduplication using user supplied ID keys, and a disk backed filter. Onyx
0.10 automatically provides exactly once aggregations without requiring user supplied ID keys, and is
far more performant than 0.9 for this purpose.

### In Order Processing

In-order processing is now supported, greatly improving Onyx's
applicability for applications where order matters. Applications for in-order processing include pattern
detection, applications where dependencies between data is important e.g. [Command Query Responsibility
Segregation (CQRS)](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html), and [Complex
Event Processing (CEP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing).

### Greatly Improved Performance

Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting has a much lower acking / fault tolerance
overhead than 0.9's lineage tracking method. Additional performance
enhancements ensures that 0.10 can be anywhere from 3-10X faster than onyx
0.9, depending on the features used, and the amount of application level work being performed.

## New Features

Onyx 0.10 also introduces numerous important features and improvements, including the following:

### Resume Points

[Resume points](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx/blob/0.10.x/doc/user-guide/resume-points.adoc)
is a new feature that make it simple to manage state between job runs. Resume
points allow for state to be transitioned from running or killed jobs. This
allows for simplified deployment and upgrades of long running streaming jobs,
refactoring of jobs e.g. split state from one job into two smaller jobs, as
well as hot swapped state transitions - made possible due to the immutability of the state snapshots.

### Trigger to Downstream Tasks

Triggers can now emit aggregates to downstream tasks via
[`:trigger/emit`](http://www.onyxplatform.org/docs/cheat-sheet/latest/#trigger-entry/:trigger/emit).
`:trigger/emit` allows for multiple levels of aggregation, output 
aggregation results to Onyx output mediums and more.

### Improved Fault Tolerance

Peers now include improved heartbeating, and perform peer to peer [liveness
checks](http://www.onyxplatform.org/docs/cheat-sheet/latest/#peer-config/:onyx.peer/subscriber-liveness-timeout-ms)
on each other in addition to the existing ZooKeeper watches. Stuck or dead peers will
now be more readily detected by Onyx, ensuring tolerance to additional classes
of faults.

### Simplified Plugin Interfaces

The input and output plugin interfaces have been greatly simplified. The input
plugin interface in 0.9.x required developers to manually checkpoint state. 0.10
provides this checkpointing for free as part of the asynchronous snapshotting functionality. All a plugin needs is to return the data
to be snapshotted, and the snapshot will be asynchronously stored by Onyx.

### S3 Checkpointing Backend

State checkpointing now supports checkpointing to Amazon S3. BookKeeper is no
longer required for windowing/trigger support, greatly reducing operational
complexity of your Onyx cluster.

### Improved Metrics

[Prometheus metrics](https://prometheus.io/) endpoints are now provided via
[onyx-peer-http-query](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx-peer-http-query).
Numerous additional metrics are now also supported, giving even greater
introspection into your cluster.
