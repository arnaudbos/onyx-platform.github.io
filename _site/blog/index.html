We’ve also shipped a number of highly requested usability fixes that will make developing with Onyx much more pleasant. See the full changelog for all patches to 0.9.7. We’re frequently asked about the maturity of Onyx, so in this post, I’m going to discuss the design changes that we made - specifically in the context...</p>

A data structure based API forces you to understand and decide all-the-things upfront. A common approach to conquer this problem is to include a sort of meta-language in the data structure. In all but the simplest cases, this leads to recreating a new programming language in your...</p>

Onyx programs are described in immutable data structures allowing jobs to cross language and machine boundaries at runtime.
